    *     (three kings, two kings and a man, or one king and two men), the game is drawn after both players

    *   - When one player has only a king left, and the other player two pieces or less, including at least
    *     one king (one king, two kings, or one king and a man), the game is drawn after both players made 5
    *     moves.
